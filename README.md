ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a proactive and solution-focused professional with a strong interest in technical support and IT systems management.  
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to bridge the gap between technical challenges and seamless user experiences.  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in L2 support, testing, and exploring how things work behind the scenes.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PowerShell scripting to enhance my automation skills.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: malikova.nika@gmail.com  
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm too introverted but thrive in problem-solving and technical discussions.
